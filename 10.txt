Maxwell was handed an ODI and T20I debut, owing to his consistent limited-over performances in the domestic circuit. He had some good all-round outings, playing the jack-of-all-trades role for Australia, including a 56 against Pakistan in his 2nd ODI. However, he remained a fringe player and didn't manage to cement his spot in the side. However, with the backing of excellent domestic form and some useful performances in International cricket, along with his handy off-spin bowling, he was picked in the squad for the 2012 World T20 in Sri Lanka.
